# MyFirstRespository

1) A Gitrespository is like a folder containing everything in your projects. This includes all the assets, images, documents and etc.

2) Two special features of Gitrespository is that ability for you to back up all of your file on a branch so in case you mess up something and need to revert back to an older version, it is always there. Another feature would be the ability for others to commit to your work which promotes collaborative effort and for others to help you when you need it.

3) These features help in my collaborative project because it allows for others to make changes to your work, and you can see what changes they have made. If you don't agree with these changes, you can revert back to an older version. However if you do, you can accept the pull request and merge it into your main branch that your working on.
